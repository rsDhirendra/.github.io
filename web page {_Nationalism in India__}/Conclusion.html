Conclusion<p><HR WIDTH=20% ALIGN="LEFT">
A growing anger against the colonial government was thus bringing
together various groups and classes of Indians into a common struggle
for freedom in the first half of the twentieth century. The Congress
under the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi tried to channel people’s
grievances into organised movements for independence. Through
such movements the nationalists tried to forge a national unity. But
as we have seen, diverse groups and classes participated in these
movements with varied aspirations and expectations. As their
grievances were wide-ranging, freedom from colonial rule also meant
different things to different people. The Congress continuously
attempted to resolve differences, and ensure that the demands of
one group did not alienate another. This is precisely why the unity
within the movement often broke down. The high points of
Congress activity and nationalist unity were followed by phases of
disunity and inner conflict between groups.
In other words, what was emerging was a nation with many voices
wanting freedom from colonial rule.</p>
