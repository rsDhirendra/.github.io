        In <I>India</I>, as in Vietnam and many other colonies, the growth of
 modern nationalism is intimately connected to the anti-colonial
 movement. People began discovering their unity in the process of
 their struggle with colonialism. The sense of being oppressed under
 colonialism provided a shared bond that tied many different groups
 together.<BR> But each class and group felt the effects of colonialism
 differently, their experiences were varied, and their notions of
 freedom were not always the same. The Congress under Mahatma
 Gandhi tried to forge these groups together within one movement.
 But the unity did not emerge without conflict.</P>

 In an earlier textbook you have read about the growth of nationalism
 in India up to the first decade of the twentieth century. <BR>
 we will pick up the story from the 1920s and study the Non-
 Cooperation and Civil Disobedience Movements. We will explore
 how the Congress sought to develop the national movement, how
 different social groups participated in the movement, and how
 nationalism captured the imagination of people.</P>

 First of all, the war created a new economic and political situation.
 It led to a huge increase in defence expenditure which was financed
 by war loans and increasing taxes: customs duties were raised and
 income tax introduced. Through the war years prices increased –
 doubling between 1913 and 1918 – leading to extreme hardship
 for the common people. Villages were called upon to supply soldiers,
 and the <i>forced recruitment</i> in rural areas caused widespread anger.
 Then in 1918-19 and 1920-21, crops failed in many parts of India,
 resulting in acute shortages of food. This was accompanied by an
 influenza epidemic. According to the census of 1921, 12 to 13 million
 people perished as a result of famines and the epidemic.
 People hoped that their hardships would end after the war was
 over. But that did not happen.
 At this stage a new leader appeared and suggested a new mode
 of struggle.</p><hr>

<H1>   Satyagraha  </H1><hr width =30% align="left"></FONT>

Mahatma Gandhi returned to India in January 1915. As you know,
he had come from South Africa where he had successfully fought the racist regime with a novel method of mass agitation, which he
called satyagraha. The idea of satyagraha emphasised the power of
truth and the need to search for truth. It suggested that if the cause
was true, if the struggle was against injustice, then physical force was
not necessary to fight the oppressor. Without seeking vengeance or
being aggressive, a satyagrahi could win the battle through nonviolence.
This could be done by appealing to the conscience of the
oppressor. People – including the oppressors – had to be persuaded
to see the truth, instead of being forced to accept truth through the
use of violence. By this struggle, truth was bound to ultimately
triumph. Mahatma Gandhi believed that this dharma of non-violence
could unite all Indians.
After arriving in India, Mahatma Gandhi successfully organised
satyagraha movements in various places. <br><br>
In 1916 he travelled to
Champaran in Bihar to inspire the peasants to struggle against the
oppressive plantation system.<br><br> 
Then in 1917, he organised a satyagraha
to support the peasants of the Kheda district of Gujarat. Affected
by crop failure and a plague epidemic, the peasants of Kheda could
not pay the revenue, and were demanding that revenue collection be
relaxed. <br></FONT><FONT FACE="Segoe Script" SIZE "7" >

‘It is said of “passive resistance” that it is the
weapon of the weak, but the power which is
the subject of this article can be used only
by the strong. This power is not passive
resistance; indeed it calls for intense activity. The
movement in South Africa was not passive
but active …
‘ Satyagraha is not physical force. A satyagrahi
does not inflict pain on the adversary; he does
not seek his destruction … In the use of
satyagraha, there is no ill-will whatever.
‘ Satyagraha is pure soul-force. Truth is the very
substance of the soul. That is why this force is
called satyagraha. The soul is informed with
knowledge. In it burns the flame of love. … Nonviolence
is the supreme dharma …
‘It is certain that India cannot rival Britain or
Europe in force of arms. The British worship the
war-god and they can all of them become, as
they are becoming, bearers of arms. The
hundreds of millions in India can never carry arms.
They have made the religion of non-violence their
own ...</B></TD></TR></TABLE></FONT>
